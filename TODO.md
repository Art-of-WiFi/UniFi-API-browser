## TODO:

1. Make the output format selectable like with the siteid, so that after selection we can switch between the two lines below for different output presentation. Possible options to add are ~~PHP array/json~~/table/chart:
    - DataTables for table output and more
        - requires "flattening" of multidimensional arrays/objects
        - or else only expose a selection of attributes
    - Chart output as option for certain data collections (and selected attributes)
        - same requirements as for tables

2. Add the option to export data to CSV file format
    - need to have the option to select which fields to export
    - could be combined with the DataTables output option
    - requires "flattening" of multidimensional arrays/objects
